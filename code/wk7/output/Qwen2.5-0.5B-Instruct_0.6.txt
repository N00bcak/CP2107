Number of responses : 1
A:  To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, we first need to find its prime factorization.

Starting with the number 196, we divide it by the smallest prime number, which is 2:

\[ 98 \div 2 = 49 \]
Since 49 is not divisible by 2, we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3. We divide 49 by 3:
\[ 49 \div 3 = 16.3333\ldots \]
Since 16.3333... is not a whole number, we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 5. We divide 16 by 5:
\[ 16 \div 5 = 3.2 \]
Since 3.2 is not a whole number, we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 7. We divide 3 by 7:
\[ 3 \div 7 = 0.428571\ldots \]
