Q: How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?
Number of responses : 1
A:  To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, we start by finding its prime factorization. We know that:

\[ 196 = 2^2 \times 7^2 \]

The formula to find the number of divisors of a number from its prime factorization is to add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply the results. For the number 196, the exponents are 2 and 2. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

So, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \(\boxed{9}\).
