Q: How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?
Number of responses : 1
A: To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, we start by finding its prime factorization. 

First, we check if 196 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 196 is even, it is divisible by 2:
\[ 196 \div 2 = 98 \]
So, we can write:
\[ 196 = 2 \times 98 \]

Next, we factorize 98. Since 98 is even, it is divisible by 2:
\[ 98 \div 2 = 49 \]
So, we can write:
\[ 98 = 2 \times 49 \]
Thus, the prime factorization of 196 is:
\[ 196 = 2^2 \times 49 \]

Now, we need to factorize 49. Since 49 is not divisible by 2, we check for divisibility by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 49 is 4 + 9 = 13, which is not divisible by 3, so 4

Q: What is the range of output of tanh?
Number of responses : 1
A: The range of output for the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function is (-1, 1). This means that tanh(x) will always be between -1 and 1, inclusive. The function takes any real number as input and outputs a value between -1 and 1, with the value approaching 0 as the input approaches infinity or negative infinity.
