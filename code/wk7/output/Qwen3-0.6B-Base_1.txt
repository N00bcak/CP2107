Q: What is the range of output of tanh?
Number of responses : 1
A:   The hyperbolic tangent function, denoted as tanh(x), is defined as tanh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x)). The range of the hyperbolic tangent function is from -1 to 1, inclusive. This means that tanh(x) will always be between -1 and 1, and can take on any value in that range.
