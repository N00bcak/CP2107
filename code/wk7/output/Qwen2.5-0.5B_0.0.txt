Q: How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?
Number of responses : 1
A:  To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, we start by finding its prime factorization. We have:

\[ 196 = 2^2 \times 7^2 \]

The formula to find the number of divisors of a number from its prime factorization is to add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply the results. For the number \(196 = 2^2 \times 7^2\), the exponents are 2 and 2. Adding 1 to each exponent gives us 3 and 3. Therefore, the number of divisors is:

\[ (2+1)(2+1) = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

So, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]

Q: What is the range of output of tanh?
Number of responses : 1
A:  I am trying to understand the range of the function tanh(x). I know that the range of tanh(x) is [-1, 1]. But I am not sure how to find the range of tanh(x) for any x. Can someone please explain how to find the range of tanh(x) for any x? To find the range of the function \(\tanh(x)\), we need to understand the behavior of the hyperbolic tangent function, \(\tanh(x)\). The hyperbolic tangent function is defined as:

\[
\tanh(x) = \frac{\sinh(x)}{\cosh(x)}
\]

where \(\sinh(x)\) and \(\cosh(x)\) are the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions, respectively. The hyperbolic sine function is given by:

\[
\sinh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}
\]

and the hyperbolic cosine function is given by:

\[
\cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}
\]

The hyperbolic sine and cosine functions are periodic with period \(2\pi\), and they are strictly increasing and strictly
