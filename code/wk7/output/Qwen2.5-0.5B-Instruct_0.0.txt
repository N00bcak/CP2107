Q: How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?
Number of responses : 1
A:  To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, we start by finding its prime factorization.

First, we divide 196 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
\[ 196 \div 2 = 98 \]
So, we can write:
\[ 196 = 2 \times 98 \]
Next, we factorize 98. Since 98 is even, it is divisible by 2:
\[ 98 \div 2 = 49 \]
So, we can write:
\[ 98 = 2 \times 49 \]
Next, we factorize 49. Since 49 is not divisible by 2, we check for divisibility by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 49 is 4 + 9 = 13, which is not divisible by 3, so 49 is not divisible by 3. We then check for divisibility by 5, but 49 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. We then check for divisibility by 7:

Q: The capital of Singapore is
Number of responses : 1
A:  located in the city-state's:
A. South
B. North
C. East
D. West

To determine the capital of Singapore, we need to consider its geographical location. Singapore is located in Southeast Asia, specifically in the southern part of the country. The capital of Singapore is located in the southern part of the country, which is the southern tip of the island.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A. South

So, the capital of Singapore is located in the southern part of the country. The other options are incorrect because the capital is not in the north, east, or west. The capital is in the southern part of the country. 

The answer is: A. South.

Q: What is the range of output of tanh?
Number of responses : 1
A:  The range of the hyperbolic tangent function, tanh(x), is [-1, 1]. This means that the output of tanh(x) will always be between -1 and 1, inclusive. The function tanh(x) is defined as:

\[ \text{tanh}(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} \]

The range of tanh(x) is therefore [-1, 1]. This is because the function approaches -1 as x approaches -infinity and approaches 1 as x approaches infinity. The function never actually reaches -1 or 1, but it gets arbitrarily close to these values. 

To summarize, the range of tanh(x) is:

\[ \boxed{[-1, 1]} \] 

This is the set of all possible values that tanh(x) can take as x varies over all real numbers. The function tanh(x) is a continuous and strictly increasing function, so it will take on every value between -1 and 1, inclusive. The function never actually reaches these values, but it gets arbitrarily close to them. The range of tanh(x) is [-1, 1]. The function tanh(x

Please answer the following question: What is the meaning of life?
Number of responses : 1
A:  Is it a question that can be answered with a simple yes or no? If so, what is the answer? If not, what is the meaning of life according to your perspective? If you were to answer this question, what would be the most important aspect of the answer? The meaning of life is a philosophical question that has been debated for centuries. It is a question that can be answered with a simple yes or no, but it is not a straightforward answer. The answer to the meaning of life is subjective and varies from person to person. Some people believe that the meaning of life is to find happiness and fulfillment, while others believe that it is to serve a higher power or to contribute to society. Ultimately, the meaning of life is a personal and subjective matter that cannot be answered with a simple yes or no. The most important aspect of the answer would be to consider the value and significance of life, and to reflect on what makes us happy and fulfilled. It would also be important to consider the impact that we have on the world and the people around us. Ultimately, the meaning of life is a complex and multifaceted question that requires a deep reflection and consideration of our own values and beliefs.
