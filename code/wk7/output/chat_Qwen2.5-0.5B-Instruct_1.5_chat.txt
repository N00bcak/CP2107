Q: How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?
Number of responses : 1
A: To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, we start by finding its prime factorization. The number 196 is a well-known multiple:

\[ 196 = 16 \times 12 = 2^4 \times 3 \times 2^2 = 2^6 \times 3 \]

A divisor of 196 will be a positive integer form as well as the multiples of the factors of 196. To find the number of divisors, we apply the following logic:

If \( n \) is the number of divisors of a positive integer \( a \), then each divisor of \( a \) has a corresponding divisor \( a-n \). If we write \( n \) factorization of 196, the corresponding factorization would be using odd divisors. Let \( d(m) \) denote the exponent of a prime \( p \) in the prime factorization of \( n \). So \( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \), where \( n = prod(p_1^{a_i^{e_i}} dot prod(p

Q: What is the range of output of tanh?
Number of responses : 1
A: The output range for the TanH function is typically between -1 and 1, inclusive. TanH formally means "arctanh," so this number represents \(\tan^{-1}\) of that number, which uses the naturally occurring \(\tan^{-1}\) functionality from C/C++. However, many programming languages explicitly standardize \(\tanh\) version of TanH function with function equivalent-equivalent not reduced quitesqrt expectations basequis as nearest.M
