Q: How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?
Number of responses : 1
A:  To find the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, we can start by factoring 196 into its prime factors. Then, we can use the formula for finding the number of divisors based on the prime factorization.

First, let's factor 196. We know that 196 is equal to 14 squared, which is (2*7)^2. Therefore, 196 can be written as 2^2 * 7^2.

Now, the formula for the number of positive divisors of a number is to take the product of each prime factor's exponent plus one. So, for 2^2 * 7^2, the number of divisors is (2+1)*(2+1) = 3*3 = 9.

Therefore, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is 9.

To confirm, let's list all the divisors of 196. The prime factorization is 2^2 * 7^2. The divisors are generated by multiplying combinations of 2^a * 7^b where a ranges from 0 to 2 and b ranges from 0 to

Q: What is the range of output of tanh?
Number of responses : 1
A:  What is the range of tanh? What is the range of tanh? What is the range of tanh?

Okay, so I need to figure out the range of the hyperbolic tangent function, tanh. Hmm, I remember that tanh is defined as the hyperbolic tangent, which is (e^x - e^{-x}) / (e^x + e^{-x}), right? Let me confirm that. Yeah, that formula makes sense because it's the ratio of the exponential terms. 

Now, the question is about the range. The range of a function is the set of all possible output values it can produce. So, for tanh, I need to find all real numbers y such that tanh(y) = y. Wait, no, that's not right. The range of tanh is the set of all real numbers between -1 and 1. Let me think. 

Let me recall that tanh is defined for all real numbers, but it's only defined for real numbers where the denominator isn't zero. But since the function is defined for all real numbers, the range should be between -1 and 1. Let me check with some examples. 

For example, when x approaches infinity, tanh
