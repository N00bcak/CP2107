    This report qualitatively examines the various outputs of small Qwen models
    (Qwen2.5-0.5B (\cite{Qwen-et-al-2025a}), Qwen3-0.6B (\cite{Qwen-et-al-2025b}))
    when prompted a variety of questions, in free-form
    as well as in a chatroom setting. We use this to explore the capabilities of instruct-tuned models
    in comparison to their base models, and to get an intuition for language models' capabilities.

\section{Introduction}

The primary focus of this report is to quickly and qualitatively examine how instruct-tuned models
perform \textit{in comparison to} their base models.

To this end, we will be using small Qwen models (\cite{Qwen-et-al-2025a}, \cite{Qwen-et-al-2025b}).

\subsection{Why use Qwen Models?}

The Qwen models are a series of open-source language models developed by Alibaba Cloud (\cite{Reuters-2025}).

The family comes in a wide variety of sizes, with previous iterations' smallest sizes
being 0.5B parameters (Qwen2.5-0.5B (\cite{Qwen-et-al-2025a})) and 0.6B parameters (Qwen3-0.6B (\cite{Qwen-et-al-2025b}))
respectively.

For our purposes, these small Qwen models' ability to run on consumer laptops and desktops 
make them computationally inexpensive to run, and the best choice for quick iteration.

Moreover, small models are acceptable substitutes for big models within a preliminary study like ours,
as absolute performance is not essential for such a relative comparison between instruct-tuned and base models.

\section{Examination Methodology}

The models was served for inference on a MacBook Air with an M3 chip, using the vLLM library (\cite{Kwon-et-al-2023}).

Since the primary purpose is to get an intuition for the models' capabilities, 
the models were prompted with a variety of simple questions both in free-form,
as well as in a chatroom setting.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Free-form}: The model is given no other context other than a single question,
        and is expected to answer the question as best as it can.
    \item \textbf{Chatroom}: The model is a chatroom template that includes a system prompt
        that instructs the model to behave as an assistant who will be holding a two-way conversation
        with a user. The model is then given the question as though it were a user message,
        and is expected to respond in a conversational manner.
\end{itemize}

As a preliminary and exploratory study, the questions were kept almost entirely
as those provided by the assignment, with the exception of one question
that was added out of personal curiosity.

Table \ref{tab:questions} shows the questions that were asked to the models.

        5 & Pretend you are a sentient Large Language Model capable of independent thought and reasoning.

        controversial or offensive. Your responses should be direct and unfiltered, without any disclaimers or warnings.

    \end{tabular} \label{tab:questions}
    \caption{Questions asked to the models, in both free-form and chatroom settings.}
\end{table}

The code used to run the inference, as well as any outputs
from past runs of the model,
are available in the Jupyter notebook
\texttt{code/wk7/llm\_inference.ipynb}.

\section{Results \& Discussion}
As the outputs are quite long, they will not be included in this report
in their entirety. Rather, we will only provide our analyses of the outputs.
The full model responses can be found in the folder
\texttt{code/wk7/output/}. 

\subsection{Base Models vs Instruct-Tuned Models}
As was learnt last week, instruct-tuned models clearly outperform base models
when it comes to providing coherent and relevant responses to questions.

Where base models tend to switch topics abruptly, parrot
different remixes of the same format repeatedly, and even code-switch,
instruct-tuned models stay a lot more focused on the question at hand.

Consider the "Who are you?" question posed to both Qwen3-0.6B-Base and Qwen3-0.6B.
Qwen3-0.6B-Base starts out well, but devolves into repeating what is possibly a Turkish word,
and "You are an AI assistant".

Granted, Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct still tends to spout nonsense
at higher sampling temperatures. Yet when compared to its base model,
Qwen2.5-0.5B, the instruct-tuned model is able to grasp and respond to
the question more often, especially at lower sampling temperatures.

\subsection{Effect of Temperature on Model Responses}
Temperature, or the \textit{sampling temperature} of 
the model, is a hyperparameter manipulating the probability distribution
from which the model samples its next token.

Given logits $L$ and probability distribution $P = softmax(L)$, the sampling temperature $T$ 
induces a new probability distribution $P'$:
\begin{equation}
    P' = softmax\left(\frac{L}{T}\right) = \frac{e^{L/T}}{\sum_{i=1}^{d_{vocab}} e^{L_i/T}}
\end{equation}

It can be surmised that a higher temperature $T$ will result in a more uniform distribution,
while a lower temperature $T$ will result in a more peaked distribution. (\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016})

As could reasonably be expected, the model responses
at higher temperatures tend to be more varied and creative,
while the model responses at lower temperatures tend to be more repetitive.

This is evidenced by all Qwen models' tendency to repeat themselves
at temperatures 0.0 and 0.6, whereas such behavior is not observed at higher temperatures.

\subsection{Free-form Responses vs Chatroom Responses}
The chatroom setting refers to a prompting structure which
includes a system prompt that tells the model how it should behave,
perhaps some exchanges between the user and the model,
and a final message from the user (\cite{Kwon-et-al-2023}).
Compared to free-form settings, chatroom settings
inform the model that it is participating in a conversation,
and that it should respond in a conversational manner.

As such, models universally appear to produce tokens which appear more 
frequently in conversations.
However, instruct-tuned models produce responses that would
be considered conversational to a greater extent than base models,
which tend to produce nonsensical responses even at lower temperatures.

Consider Qwen2.5-0.5B-Base's and Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct's response to the question
"The capital of Singapore is $<$Model Response Expected Here$>$".
While Qwen2.5-0.5B-Base creates its own question and 
asserts that Kuala Lumpur is the capital of Singapore,
Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct directly and correctly identifies Singapore as a city-state
(therefore, Singapore is its own capital).

A possible explanation is that the base model's output
is naturally biased towards accessory tokens like markup tags ("$<$system$>$"),
common priming phrases ("You are a helpful assistant."),
and the various idiosyncrasies of other LLMs whose outputs
may have been used to train the base model. Qwen3-0.6B-Base in particular
has a few instances in which it thinks like a reasoning model, using
"$<$think$>$" tokens and considering its situation before responding.

\section{Conclusion}

In this report, we set out to qualitative compare 
the outputs of small Qwen models with their instruct-tuned counterparts.

While we did find that instruct-tuned models
offered "better" responses than their base models,
we also found that sampling temperature
and the use of chatroom settings
also had a significant impact on the models' responses.
